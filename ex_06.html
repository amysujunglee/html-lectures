    <p>This is a paragraph of text. Let’s pretend it’s part of a long article, where we expect many people to quickly scan through it, and we want to mark certain phrases with some boldness, some visual attention, so that those sentences jump out and people don’t miss them. Almost like having a pull-quote.</p>
